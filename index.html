A Guide to Capacity Development

Capacity development is one of the most frequently used terms in the organizational world today. Nearly every major consulting firm has departments, services, or operations dedicated exclusively to organizational capacity development. Evidently, they have enough clients requesting these services to justify this. Meanwhile, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) considers capacity development to be a cornerstone concept in its activities; they have a Capacity Development Office and over 200 publications related to the subject. The UNDP isn’t alone here in the global development community. The OECD calculates that 25% of all of global aid is dedicated to capacity building; at last count this amounts to over US$15bn (nearly CAD$20bn) per year. 

Unfortunately, as a concept increases in popularity, there seems to be an inverse relationship to its usefulness. As researchers publish white papers espousing the merits of developing capacity through increasing training protocols, new infrastructure, and reworking stakeholder relationships, practitioners talk about doing more with less, the value of intuition, and respecting local culture. At best this can expand the scope of what capacity development means, at worst it blurs lines and causes confusion. 

With this project, we’re not looking to wade this debate. Our goal is straightforward: to inform a reader about some of the foundations of a capacity development practitioner skill set, and showcase some illustrative projects utilizing these skill sets. 

The University of Guelph is proud to be one of only two schools in the world that offers a graduate level degree in capacity development. Most of the examples in the current iteration will be drawn from the experiences and knowledge base of graduates in this program. 

A simple definition

Capacity development, in its simplest form, is as it sounds. While we risk breaking the cardinal rule of every english dictionary, capacity development is quite literally about developing the capacity of an individual, organization, society, or a system. There’s really very little special meaning embedded in each of these terms. By capacity we mean ability or means, roughly speaking. By development we mean growth, expansion, or evolution. It’s true though, that certain circumstances might lend themselves to a modified use of the term. For instance, a project focused on adopting a process within a group might by necessity also involve a change in attitude, belief, or perspective. While this might already seem to be getting a bit tenuous, it’s worth recalling the importance of the culture of any project or organization you’ve been involved with. It seems likely that most practitioners would agree that culture is a key piece of any successful endeavour. There’s a deep relationship between attitudes, beliefs, perspectives, and culture; while they might not be synonymous, they are certainly interrelated and almost certainly co-existent. So when a practitioner of capacity development speaks of engaging with stakeholders or empowering a group, what she likely means is starting from a place of respecting the individuals involved, and their culture. The connotation here is one of listening and understanding. This is nothing new; listening to -even collaborating with- clients has become a mainstay of business dynamics, and government programs have become increasingly focused on being responsive to the needs of their constituents through dialogue and feedback mechanisms. Still, it can be difficult to measure culture, and this has caused a few problems.

Culture Change is Hard

Considering this definition, you might be lead to the thought that it’s pretty difficult to effectively execute on any project that needs to include some aspect of cultural change. You’d be something close to right about this. If you’re involved in management at all, you’ve probably come across an expert who will state that 70% of change efforts fail. This statistic comes from a 1993 book titled reengineering the corporation, by Michael Hammer and James Champy, which explicitly states (emphasis ours): 

“our unscientific estimate if that as many as 50 to 70 percent of the organizations that undertake a reengineering effort do not achieve the dramatic results they intended.” 

This statistic has taken on something of a life of its own and has been repeated as a flat 70% across many peer-reviewed journals, right up to today. But two years after publication (in 1995), the authors published The Reengineering Revolution, where they attempt a clarification:

“In Reengineering the Corporation, we estimated that between 50 and 70 percent of reengineering efforts were not successful in achieving the desired breakthrough performance. Unfortunately, this simple descriptive observation has been widely misrepresented and transmogrified and distorted into a normative statement...”  

The truth, it seems, is a little more complicated than that. In a Harvard Business Review article on exactly this topic, Nick Tasler cites a McKinsey survey of some 1,500 executives, noting that only 38% responded that their cultural change initiatives were ‘completely’ or ‘mostly’ successful. While not exactly an optimistic headline, it’s worth noting that only about 10% of respondents replied that they were ‘completely’ or ‘mostly’ unsuccessful. What this means is that it’s likely that very nearly 50% of respondent felt somewhere in the middle between these extremes. Tasler remarks in that this is analogous to a baseball player not hitting a home-run and being labeled a failure, whereas in reality, only 1 in 10 are absolute strikeouts. In other words, yes, changing a culture requires effort, and it's messy, but in many cases, it’s also necessary, and we likely aren’t doing ourselves any favors by calling it impossible. Instead, a best-practice here might be to bring along some individuals who have trained in this subject. Ideally, they’ve got some mix of theory and practice. They should probably also have an idea of how to model a scenario, or provide a few possible frameworks to operate from. What we’ll next consider is how this messiness of change interacts with the core competencies of capacity development practitioners. 

Core Competencies

Capacity development practitioners are likely to come from all walks of life - some have strong backgrounds in agriculture, rural development or policy, while others come from experience in startups, medicine, urban design, or finance. Similar to a person who has achieved a planning, project management, or facilitation designation, a practitioner of capacity development brings their prior experience to this scope of practice willingly and likely incorporates it into their practice. 

Systems

Systems are a group of objects, entities, or artifacts that interact in some meaningful way. Systems tend to be delineated by boundaries (such as time, space, or identity), though these boundaries can be porous or misidentified. Systems can be simple, complex, or be labeled with another unique identifier (scale-free, nonlinear, and others). A hallmark of a complex system is a system which the sum of the parts are greater than the whole, i.e. there is an emergent behaviour or property that is very difficult or even impossible to predict given the components parts of the system. This is usually due to relationships within the system. To go one step further, a complex adaptive system is one that not only has emergent behaviour as a result of the relationship between the system’s parts, but also adapts to external or environmental changes with macro-structure characteristic. Systems, while difficult to model, are often represented as networks, which represent not only the components of the system but the relationship between them. Capacity development practitioners are particularly interested in the relationship of the entities of the system to each other, and the environment in which they are interacting. A capacity development practitioner may include concepts like policy, values, beliefs, power, or ethics in their consideration of the system.

The Santa Fe Institute has a number programs related to complex systems in a wide variety of fields (physical, biological, social, cultural, technological, and even possible astrobiological worlds)

Networks

Networks are a representation of real-world or theoretical groupings of entities and the relationship of those entities. The study of networks is unsurprisingly called network science, and encompasses a number of fields and types of networks like social networks, biological networks, or semantic networks. Network scientists are typically interested in not only the agents of the network or their connections, but also the topology or density of the network, the average path length (the average number of jumps from one entity to another), clustering, influence and others. Multiple network models exist, such as the Watts-Strogatz small world model, which has a very high clustering property and is related to the well-known theory “six degrees of separation”

Innovation

Innovation is viewed by capacity development practitioners simply as ‘putting new knowledge to use’. Innovation can be product, service, or process oriented, but it can also be institutional (e.g. Changing the rules of the game). This is important to consider, because organizational development and management research are increasingly showing that for an innovation to be successful, certain cultural parameters need to be met. Consider things that were “ahead of their time”. Usually they failed because the environment they existed in wasn’t supportive or responsive to it, not because it wasn’t a good idea. This is where networks and systems begin to interact with innovation - individuals and institutions typically make up the environment in which the innovation will exist. They also make up the environment in which the innovation is created. An environment where risk-taking is encouraged, commonplace, and socially acceptable might be a good place for an innovation to occur, for example. In any case, capacity development practitioners are interested in creating relationships that escape the traditional linear (producer->consumer) model, towards something that focuses on co-production, reduced transaction costs, and facilitated innovation; this is typically referred to as Innovation brokerage.

Leadership

Leadership is skill or characteristic commonly associated with ability of an entity to have an effect on the entities around it. Leadership can take place at the individual, group, organizational, or system level, and it tend to cross-cut across levels (e.g. a individual leader can effect change on other individuals, forming a group, which can alter the system). There are a wide number of conceptual frameworks of leadership, running the gamut from analyzing the personality, behaviour and characteristics of a single individual leader to leadership being conceptualized as a relational process and much less focused on positionality.  Within Capacity development, there is a strong trend to focus on leadership as distributed authority. In the global development sphere, this takes shape as ‘localization’ of aid programmes, not only tailored but essentially managed and driven by local individuals, groups, or institutions. By allowing for flexibility, shared leadership, autonomy, and the co-production of the output, meaning and value is developed by the group instead of handed down. It’s easy to see how the culture from this sort of environment would differ from something more ‘aid delivery’ oriented, where an external entity comes into a space and delivers projects, goods or services to the local population. 	

In the corporate world, there are striking similarities that have quite become popular in the past decade. Many companies seek to download responsibility to the lowest level possible to make effective decisions quickly, if not on-the-spot. In agile methodologies, the servant-leader is considered key to the organizational process; this is someone who has a significant portfolio of responsibility in removing impediments for the rest of the team, who are self-directed or facilitated towards effective decisions.

A wide number of resources exist on leadership - some common search terms might be situational leadership, followership, or team-based leadership. 

Looking ahead

While capacity development as a term has been in regular use for twenty or thirty years, in many ways it’s still in its infancy. It seems worth mentioning that within capacity development, research and practice are often seen not as opposing ends of a spectrum but as fundamentally interconnected. Practitioners tend to be very well trained in research design and mixed methods involving both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The results from this blend of practice and research are partly what has led to the relevancy of many of the concepts listed above. While it's impossible to know for sure, it seems likely that increased shared accountability and network modeled hierarchies are set to outpace vertical hierarchies and authoritarian approaches across sectors. If this is the case, the importance of developing individual, organizational and systems-level capacity will only increase.
